// 1. Declare a class named "Record" in this file which has two properties on the props property: name and favorite sport.
// 2. Add a render method which displays the two properties using a template literal
// 3. Create an entry point (index.js) in this directory, and arrange it to both import and instantiate the class.
// 4. Modify the rendered string based on one or two potential sports, with a generic rendering otherwise. Use an if statement.
